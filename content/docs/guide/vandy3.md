Since 2006, IEPM alumni have been recording their contact information and job details to build a networking system. When looking for internships, current students often reach out to previous alumni, which greatly helps in securing opportunities.

⚠️ Alumni information is exclusive to the program, so this is a general summary without specific details.<br>

## Alumni Data from the Past Five Years (2018-2022)

1️⃣ Approximately 80 students graduated from IEPM between 2018 and 2022, with about 25% being Chinese students.<br>
2️⃣ Around half of the graduates returned to China. Their main employment sectors include:<br>
- Sino-foreign joint universities<br>
- International high schools<br>
- Government agencies<br>
- Education companies<br>
- Roles vary across academic, research, and administrative positions.<br>

3️⃣ The other half stayed abroad:<br>
- Academic path: Some continued to pursue PhDs or second master’s degrees.<br>
- Employment path: Jobs in data analysis, academic research, and administration, mainly in U.S. universities or education companies.<br>
(Some alumni did not update their employment information.)<br>
I also reviewed data from 2006 to the present on graduates who pursued PhDs. Over 10% of IEPM graduates have either obtained or are currently pursuing a PhD.
