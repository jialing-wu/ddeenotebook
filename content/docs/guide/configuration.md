## Overview

The IEPM program requires 36 credits to graduate:
<br>
- 18 credits of required courses<br>
- 18 credits of electives<br>
- Internship experience is required<br>
- Most students graduate in two years. One student in my cohort completed the program in 1.5 years.<br>
<br>

The most standard graduation plan follows this structure:
<br>
- First year (Fall & Spring semesters): 3 courses per semester, 9 credits per semester, total 18 credits<br>
- Summer: Internship (can be taken for 0 credits)<br>
- Second year (Fall & Spring semesters): 3 courses per semester, 9 credits per semester, total 18 credits<br>
Total: 36 credits over two years<br>
<br>üíõ I highly recommend designing your course plan based on your post-graduation goals.

## Example ‚ë†: Planning for Employment After Graduation

For students who aim to work after graduation, I suggest making full use of the practicum (independent study/internship course). This course can be taken for 0, 3, or 6 credits, and allows students to apply for CPT during summer and in the second year.<br>
<br>
Suggested timeline:
<br>
- First year: Look for on-campus positions to gain experience (on-campus jobs do not require a visa sponsorship, and you don‚Äôt need to enroll in the practicum course).<br>
- Summer internship: Start looking for internships in spring semester or late fall of the previous year.<br>
You can enroll in the practicum course for 0, 3, or 6 credits (note: taking credits means paying tuition). If you take credits in the summer, you can take fewer courses in the final semester.<br>
- Second year: Take the practicum course as an elective (3/6 credits per semester) and apply for CPT internships.<br>
<br>
By graduation, you will have around 1.5 years of internship experience (in reality, due to visa restrictions, it may be slightly less‚Äîplease check official resources for precise details).
<br>
<br>
*Key points:*
<br>
The practicum course has no coursework‚Äîit is primarily for securing CPT eligibility.<br>
Pros: Helps accumulate work experience.<br>
Cons: Taking credits means paying tuition, and internship salaries may not always cover tuition costs. Some students prefer taking academic courses (like me). Choose based on your personal priorities.<br>

## Example ‚ë°: Planning for a PhD After Graduation
My experience:
<br>
- First semester: Took 3 courses to adjust to studying in the U.S.<br>
- Second semester: Took 4 courses, completing both quantitative and qualitative research methods (since I didn‚Äôt have a social science background).<br>
IEPM allows master‚Äôs students to take PhD-level courses‚ÄîI enrolled in a research-related PhD course. These courses helped me build relationships with potential PhD recommendation letter writers. With quantitative and qualitative research experience, I used my coursework projects to strengthen my CV and apply for summer research assistant (RA) positions.<br>
- Summer: Worked in a professor‚Äôs research team, gaining more research experience and additional recommendation letters.<br>
- Second year (Fall semester): Took 3 easy courses to free up time for PhD applications. Final semester: Took 2 courses.<br>
<br>
Reflection: Looking back, this timeline had a low margin for error. If I were to do it again, I would start reaching out to professors for RA positions earlier (first or second semester). I would take more advanced courses or explore electives from other departments.<br>
<br>
*Other Course Planning Options*<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ Study abroad at Columbia University for one semester (3 courses), which can also fulfill the internship requirement.<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ Cross-school program in the Business School, including an international study trip during spring break.<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Combine electives to earn a Global Health Certificate or complete two degrees in three years (M.Ed. + MPH).<br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Starting Fall 2024, Peabody College will offer four new graduate certificates‚Äîkeep an eye on updates.<br>

Summary:<br>
üí° Be bold in customizing your study path to align with your goals!
