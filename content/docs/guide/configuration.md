## Overview

The IEPM program requires 36 credits to graduate:
<br>
- 18 credits of required courses
- 18 credits of electives
- Internship experience is required
- Most students graduate in two years. One student in my cohort completed the program in 1.5 years.
<br>
The most standard graduation plan follows this structure:
<br>
- First year (Fall & Spring semesters): 3 courses per semester, 9 credits per semester, total 18 credits
- Summer: Internship (can be taken for 0 credits)
- Second year (Fall & Spring semesters): 3 courses per semester, 9 credits per semester, total 18 credits
Total: 36 credits over two years
💛 I highly recommend designing your course plan based on your post-graduation goals.

## Example ①: Planning for Employment After Graduation

For students who aim to work after graduation, I suggest making full use of the practicum (independent study/internship course). This course can be taken for 0, 3, or 6 credits, and allows students to apply for CPT during summer and in the second year.
<br>
Suggested timeline:
<br>
- First year: Look for on-campus positions to gain experience (on-campus jobs do not require a visa sponsorship, and you don’t need to enroll in the practicum course).
- Summer internship: Start looking for internships in spring semester or late fall of the previous year.
You can enroll in the practicum course for 0, 3, or 6 credits (note: taking credits means paying tuition). If you take credits in the summer, you can take fewer courses in the final semester.
- Second year: Take the practicum course as an elective (3/6 credits per semester) and apply for CPT internships.
<br>
By graduation, you will have around 1.5 years of internship experience (in reality, due to visa restrictions, it may be slightly less—please check official resources for precise details).
<br>
Key points:
<br>
The practicum course has no coursework—it is primarily for securing CPT eligibility.
Pros: Helps accumulate work experience.
Cons: Taking credits means paying tuition, and internship salaries may not always cover tuition costs. Some students prefer taking academic courses (like me). Choose based on your personal priorities.

## Example ②: Planning for a PhD After Graduation
My experience:
<br>
- First semester: Took 3 courses to adjust to studying in the U.S.
- Second semester: Took 4 courses, completing both quantitative and qualitative research methods (since I didn’t have a social science background).
IEPM allows master’s students to take PhD-level courses—I enrolled in a research-related PhD course. These courses helped me build relationships with potential PhD recommendation letter writers. With quantitative and qualitative research experience, I used my coursework projects to strengthen my CV and apply for summer research assistant (RA) positions.
- Summer: Worked in a professor’s research team, gaining more research experience and additional recommendation letters.
- Second year (Fall semester): Took 3 easy courses to free up time for PhD applications. Final semester: Took 2 courses.
<br>
Reflection: Looking back, this timeline had a low margin for error. If I were to do it again, I would start reaching out to professors for RA positions earlier (first or second semester). I would take more advanced courses or explore electives from other departments.

*Other Course Planning Options*
1️⃣ Study abroad at Columbia University for one semester (3 courses), which can also fulfill the internship requirement.<br>
2️⃣ Cross-school program in the Business School, including an international study trip during spring break.<br>
3️⃣ Combine electives to earn a Global Health Certificate or complete two degrees in three years (M.Ed. + MPH).<br>
4️⃣ Starting Fall 2024, Peabody College will offer four new graduate certificates—keep an eye on updates.<br>

Summary:
💡 Be bold in customizing your study path to align with your goals!
